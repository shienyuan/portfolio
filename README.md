When it comes to web development, I rely on modern stacks like **Vue.js**,  **Golang** and **GCP**. I stay updated with evolving technologies and engage with leading resources such as GitHub, Dev.to, and Stack Overflow. Collaboration is my passion, and I enjoy working with people to achieve exceptional results

What sets me apart is my talent for combining seamless functionality with beautiful design. I have a great eye for aesthetics and love creating experiences that put users first. From start to finish, I take pride in being the creative force behind all my personal works, including this portfolio site that showcases my versatile skills as both a designer and a developer. 

#### The everyday me:

But hey, life isn't just about coding! When I'm not immersed in lines of code, you'll find me embracing a variety of hobbies. I enjoy hitting the gym, indulging in woodworking projects, exploring my culinary skills, and capturing moments through photography. Oh, and did I mention I'm a total cat lover?

Ultimately, my goal is to create meaningful web applications that have a positive impact on people's lives. So, let's connect and join forces to create something truly extraordinary together!"
